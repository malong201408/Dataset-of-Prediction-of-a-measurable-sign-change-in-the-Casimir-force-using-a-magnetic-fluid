# Dataset-of-Prediction-of-a-measurable-sign-change-in-the-Casimir-force-using-a-magnetic-fluid
This repository shows the data we used to generate figure in the PRM paper named after "Prediction of a measurable sign change in the Casimir force using a
magnetic fluid"

https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2601.00483

Folder Fig2 stores the dielectric functions of materials
Folder Fig3 keeps the data used for Casimir pressures in cases of A-metals and different thickness of b1
Folder Fig4 holds the data for Casimir pressure for different volume fraction, diameter, and solutions
